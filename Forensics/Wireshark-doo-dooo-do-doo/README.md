<h1>Problem</h1>
Can you find the flag? [shark1.pcapng](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/ea41c400c3c7b4a63406e5e607d362ab/shark1.pcapng).

<h1>Solution</h1>

After downloading the file with the command <i>wget</i>, I opened it with Wireshark application since it is a .pcapng file.
By looking at few lines, there are a lot of HTTP traffic.
